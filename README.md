# Schneggi sensor üêå
A low power ZigBee temperature and humidity sensor integrated with HomeAssistant.

## Design Goals
- High accuracy temperature and humidity measurements ([Sensirion SHTC3](https://www.sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHTC3/))
- Designed for low power consumption and long battery life
  - Hardware: nRF52840 chip, low-current linear regulator, battery monitor with on/off capability 
  - Software: Deep sleep
- Can be powered by
  - Battery with JST connector and 3V to 6,5V (e.g. 350mAh li-poly)
  - Power supply with USB-C connector
- Small footprint (5,5cm x 4,5cm)
- Tested with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [SkyConnect](https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect/)

## PCB
The PCB was designed with KiCad 6 and manufactured/assembled with JLCPCB. All relevant files can be found at [JLCPCB](hardware/E73-2G4M08S1C-52840/jlcpcb)
