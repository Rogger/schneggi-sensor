# Schneggi sensor üêå
A low-power ZigBee sensor integrated with HomeAssistant for monitoring temperature, humidity, and CO2.

- High accuracy temperature and humidity measurements ([Sensirion SHTC3](https://www.sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHTC3/))
- High accuracy CO2 measurement ([Sensirion SCD40](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD40)) - optional board
- Low power consumption and long battery life
  - Hardware: nRF52840 chip, low-current linear regulator, battery monitor with on/off capability 
  - Software: Zigbee sleepy end device
  - Measured: 3uA average over 1 minute (without CO2). 3mA average over 1 minute (with CO2 low-power mode)
- Can be powered with 3V to 6V (JST connector), e.g. 350mAh li-poly.
- Small footprint (5cm x 4,5cm)
- Tested with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and [SkyConnect](https://www.home-assistant.io/skyconnect/)
